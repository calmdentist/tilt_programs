# zkPoker Cryptography Performance Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance benchmarks for the Paillier-based mental poker cryptographic operations and ZK-SNARK proof generation **without smart contract deployment**.

Tests were run on a standard development machine using:
- **TypeScript/Node.js** runtime
- **paillier-bigint** library for Paillier encryption
- **Simulated Groth16 ZK-SNARKs** (production would use real circom circuits)

## Performance Summary

### Complete Poker Hand (Pre-flop to Showdown)

**Total Client-Side Time: ~3.35 seconds**

Breakdown:
- Key Generation: 985ms (29%)
- Encryption Operations: 2,356ms (70%)
- ZK Proof Generation: 1.3ms (<1%)

### Detailed Metrics

#### 1. Key Generation
| Operation | Time | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Player 1 Keypair | 700ms | 2048-bit Paillier key |
| Player 2 Keypair | 286ms | 2048-bit Paillier key |
| **Total** | **986ms** | One-time cost, reusable |

**Analysis**: Key generation is the most expensive operation but only needs to happen once per match. Keys can be reused across multiple hands.

#### 2. Encryption Operations
| Operation | Time | Per Card | Count |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| Initial Encryption | 1,193ms | 22.9ms | 52 cards |
| Re-encryption | 1,163ms | 22.4ms | 52 cards |
| **Total** | **2,356ms** | **22.6ms avg** | **104 operations** |

**Analysis**: Encryption is the second bottleneck. Each hand requires encrypting the full deck twice (once per player).

#### 3. ZK-SNARK Proof Generation (Simulated)
| Proof Type | Time | Count | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|-------|
| ProveCorrectDeckCreation | 0.39ms | 1 | Verified on-chain |
| ProveCorrectReshuffle | 0.35ms | 1 | Optimistic |
| ProveCorrectDecryption | 0.55ms | 9 cards | Optimistic |
| **Total** | **1.30ms** | **11 proofs** | Negligible cost |

**Analysis**: ZK proof generation is extremely fast (simulated). Real circom circuits may be 10-100x slower but still acceptable.

#### 4. On-Chain Verification (Simulated)
| Proof Type | Time | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| ProveCorrectDeckCreation | <0.01ms | Mandatory, must pass |
| ProveCorrectReshuffle | <0.01ms | Only if disputed |
| ProveCorrectDecryption (×9) | <0.04ms | Only if disputed |
| **Total (no disputes)** | **<0.01ms** | Groth16 is very fast |

**Analysis**: On-chain verification with Groth16 + Solana precompiles is nearly instant.

- Encryption: ~4x faster (23ms → 6ms per card)
- Security: Still acceptable for most use cases
- **Total savings**: ~2 seconds per hand

### 2. Parallel Processing
**Current**: Sequential operations
**Proposed**: Parallel proof generation

**Impact**:

## Real-World Performance Estimates

### With Production Circom Circuits
| Proof Type | Simulated | Estimated Real | Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| ProveCorrectDeckCreation | 0.39ms | 50-500ms | Complex circuit (52 cards) |
| ProveCorrectReshuffle | 0.35ms | 100-1000ms | Very complex (permutation) |
| ProveCorrectDecryption | 0.06ms | 5-50ms | Simple circuit (1 card) |

### Updated Total Time (With Real Circuits)
```
Key Generation:          986ms
Deck Operations:       2,356ms
Proof Generation:    1,600ms  (estimated)
──────────────────────────────
Total:               4,942ms  (~5 seconds)
```

**Conclusion**: Even with real ZK circuits, complete hand setup should take <5 seconds, which is acceptable for poker gameplay.

## Recommendations
